        <p>Well I didn't tell anyone, but a bird flew by
            Saw what I'd done he set up a nest outside,
            And he sang about what I'd become
            He sang so loud, sang so clear
            I was afraid all the neighbours would hear,
            So I invited him in, just to reason with him
            I promised I wouldn't do it again
            But he sang louder and louder inside the house,
            And no I couldn't get him out
            So I trapped him under a cardboard box
            Stood on it to make him stop
            I picked up the bird and above the din I said
            That's the last song you'll ever sing
            Held him down, broke his neck,
            Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget
            But in my dreams began to creep
            That old familiar tweet tweet tweet
            I opened my mouth to scream and shout,
            I waved my arms and flapped about
            But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout,
            Couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
            I opened my mouth to scream and shout
            Waved my arms and flapped about
            But I couldn't scream I couldn't shout,
            The song was coming from my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth
            From my mouth</p>
